For Module 1: Challenge 1, we were given a "on the job ticket" presented with starter HTML and CSS coding and provided asset images. 

The goal of the challenge is to refactor the code to make the existing site more accesible.

First task I executed was cleaning up any redunant CSS code by combining classes with similar attributes then updating the html. In addition, I re-ordered certain css rules to grouped together such as head, hero, content, benefits, footer

Second task is I updated the search-engine-optimization nav link as it was missing #search-engine-optimization

Third task is I updated classes to be more specific to the area and assigned IDs for each

Fourth task is I changed <div> to <section> for "content" and "benefits" 

Fifth task is I cleaned up the html coding including updating the footer and adding <a> 

Sixth task I added comments to each CSS section
